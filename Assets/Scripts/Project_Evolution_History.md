# Quantum Thread - Project Evolution History

## Project Overview

This document tracks how Quantum Thread evolved from the initial idea to the finished game. It explains the development process and why I made certain technical decisions along the way.

**Note**: This covers the finalized version that was cleaned up and refined after the initial 52-hour game jam period.

**Project Theme**: "Out of Time"  
**Platform**: Unity 6  
**Genre**: Infinite 2D Side-Scrolling Grappling Hook Game  
**Diversifiers**: Gamer Bucks (in-game currency), Beyond WASD (extensive keyboard usage)

---

## Phase 1: Initial Foundation

### **Original Architecture**
I started with a basic grappling hook system using Unity's physics. The first version had:

- **PlayerSwing.cs**: Basic grappling mechanics using DistanceJoint2D
- **AnchorSpawner.cs**: Simple anchor generation
- **CameraFollow.cs**: Basic camera following with speed changes
- **GroundTiler.cs**: Simple ground tile creation

### **Problems I Found**
1. **Hard-coded values** everywhere in the code
2. **No central game manager** to coordinate everything
3. **Poor error handling** - things would break easily
4. **No audio system** at all
5. **Performance issues** with creating/destroying objects
6. **Systems were too connected** - changing one thing broke others

---

## Phase 2: Enhanced System Development

### **2.1 Centralized Game State Management**

**Problem**: No centralized game state, making death/restart logic scattered and unreliable.

**Solution**: Implemented singleton pattern with EnhancedGameManager.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// Before: Scattered death logic
if (player.transform.position.x < camera.transform.position.x - 10f)
    SceneManager.LoadScene(0);

// After: Centralized state management
public class EnhancedGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static EnhancedGameManager Instance;
    public static event Action OnPlayerDeath;
    public static event Action OnGameRestart;
    
    public void Die()
    {
        isDead = true;
        OnPlayerDeath?.Invoke();
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Centralized control** - all death logic in one place
- **Event-driven** - loose coupling between systems
- **Reliable state** - prevents duplicate death triggers
- **Easy to extend** - new systems can subscribe to events

### **2.2 Audio System Integration**

**Problem**: No audio feedback, making the game feel lifeless.

**Solution**: Complete audio system with music and SFX management.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// New system: EnhancedMusicManager
public class EnhancedMusicManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static EnhancedMusicManager Instance;
    
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip mainMenuMusic;
    [SerializeField] private AudioClip gameplayMusic;
    
    public void PlayMusicForScene(string sceneName)
    {
        // Automatic music selection based on scene
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Immersive experience** - audio feedback for all actions
- **Professional polish** - background music and SFX
- **Volume control** - integrated with options menu
- **Scene awareness** - automatic music selection

### **2.3 Object Culling System**

**Problem**: Constant Instantiate/Destroy calls causing performance issues and memory leaks.

**Solution**: Efficient object culling system with name-based detection.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// Before: No cleanup
GameObject anchor = Instantiate(anchorPrefab, position, Quaternion.identity);
// Objects accumulate forever

// After: Efficient culling
void CullObjectsBehindCamera(float cameraX)
{
    float cullX = cameraX - cullDistance;
    
    GameObject[] allObjects = FindObjectsByType<GameObject>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
    foreach (GameObject obj in allObjects)
    {
        if (obj.name.Contains("AnchorPoint") || obj.name.Contains("Collectible"))
        {
            if (obj.transform.position.x < cullX)
            {
                Destroy(obj);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Performance**: Eliminates memory leaks
- **Scalability**: Can handle hundreds of objects efficiently
- **Smooth gameplay**: No frame drops from object accumulation
- **Memory efficiency**: Destroys objects when no longer needed

## Phase 3: Feature Expansion & Diversifier Integration

### **3.1 Gamer Bucks Collectible System**

**Problem**: Need to implement "Gamer Bucks" diversifier for in-game currency.

**Solution**: Complete collectible system with visual effects and scoring.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// New system: EnhancedCollectible
public class EnhancedCollectible : MonoBehaviour
{
    public int pointsValue = 500;
    public float collectionRadius = 1f;
    
    void Update()
    {
        // Auto-collection when player gets close
        Collider2D player = Physics2D.OverlapCircle(transform.position, collectionRadius, playerLayerMask);
        if (player != null) Collect();
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Diversifier compliance**: Implements required "Gamer Bucks" feature
- **Player engagement**: Collectibles add progression and reward
- **Score integration**: Connects to existing scoring system
- **Visual appeal**: Rotating, bobbing coins are eye-catching

### **3.2 Enhanced Procedural Generation**

**Problem**: Basic spawning was predictable and not engaging.

**Solution**: Pattern-based generation with multiple anchor arrangements.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// New system: Pattern-based spawning
public enum PatternType
{
    Cluster, Line, Stairs, Pyramid, Wall, Spiral, Cross, Diamond, Square
}

void SpawnAnchorPattern()
{
    PatternType pattern = patterns[Random.Range(0, patterns.Length)];
    switch (pattern)
    {
        case PatternType.Cluster:
            SpawnClusterAt(basePosition);
            break;
        case PatternType.Line:
            SpawnLineAt(basePosition);
            break;
        // etc...
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Variety**: Multiple patterns keep gameplay interesting
- **Challenge**: Different patterns require different strategies
- **Replayability**: Random patterns mean no two runs are identical
- **Engagement**: Players must adapt to different anchor arrangements

### **3.3 Complete Upgrade System**

**Problem**: Need roguelike progression mechanics for player engagement.

**Solution**: Upgrade system with UI integration.

**Evolution**:
```csharp
// New system: UpgradeManager
public class UpgradeManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private RunUpgrade[] availableUpgrades;
    
    public void ShowUpgradeSelection()
    {
        // Display upgrade options after death
        // Apply upgrades to player systems
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Progression**: Players get stronger over time

public class DeathQuoteManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private string[] encouragingQuotes;
    [SerializeField] private string[] philosophicalQuotes;
    [SerializeField] private string[] humorousQuotes;
    
    public void ShowRandomQuote()
    {
        // Select and display random quote from appropriate category
    }
}
```

**Why This Evolution**:
- **Personality**: Adds character to the game
