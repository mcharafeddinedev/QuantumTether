# Quantum Thread - Post Mortem

## What This Document Contains

Post-mortem/analysis for Quantum Thread - I'm documenting what went well, what didn't, and what I learned during the initial development process, and the following succession of small updates before I was satisfied with it. It covers the technical stuff like system architecture and performance optimizations, plus some honest thoughts about what I'd do differently next time. Hopefully this will be useful for my future projects or if anyone else wants to understand how this game was built.

**Note**: This analysis covers the finalized version that was cleaned up and refined after the initial 52-hour game jam period.

## Project Overview

**Game**: Quantum Thread  
**Platform**: Unity 6  
**Genre**: Infinite 2D Side-Scrolling 'Grappling Hook' Game  
**Theme**: "Out of Time"  
**Diversifiers**: Gamer Bucks, Beyond WASD, Fourth Wall
**Initial Development**: 52-hour game jam  
**Post-Jam Refinement**: Additional cleanup, documentation, and optimization--a few new features and updates (~48 hrs)

## What I Built

Quantum Thread is an infinite runner where players swing between grapple points using Spider-Man style mechanics. The game features:

- **Procedural Level Generation**: Dynamic anchor spawning with patterns and hazards
- **Roguelike Upgrade System**: Player progression with impactful choices
- **Audio Integration**: Music and SFX management
- **Performance Optimization**: Object culling and efficient spawning
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular, maintainable, event-driven systems
- **UI System**: Menus, settings, pause screens, and death panels

## Key Learnings & Patterns

### 1. **Event System**

**What I Learned**: Loose coupling through events makes systems independent and maintainable.

**Pattern Used**:
```csharp
// EnhancedGameManager.cs - Central event system
public static event Action OnPlayerDeath;
public static event Action OnGameRestart;
public static event Action OnGameStart;

// Usage in other systems
void Start()
{
    EnhancedGameManager.OnPlayerDeath += OnPlayerDeath;
}

void OnDestroy()
{
    EnhancedGameManager.OnPlayerDeath -= OnPlayerDeath;
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Loose coupling** - systems don't directly reference each other
- **Easy to extend** - new systems can subscribe to events
- **Clean separation** - each system handles its own responsibilities
- **Maintainable** - changes to one system don't break others

### 2. **Singleton Design for Core Systems**

**What I Learned**: Centralized access to core systems prevents null reference issues and provides consistent state.

**Pattern Used**:
```csharp
// EnhancedGameManager.cs - Singleton implementation
public class EnhancedGameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    public static EnhancedGameManager Instance;

void Awake()
{
    if (Instance == null)
    {
        Instance = this;
        DontDestroyOnLoad(gameObject);
    }
    else
    {
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
    }
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Global access** - any system can access the game manager
- **Single source of truth** - only one instance exists
- **Scene persistence** - survives scene transitions
- **Null safety** - prevents missing reference errors

### 3. **Object Cleanup System**

**What I Learned**: Efficient object destruction prevents memory leaks and maintains performance.

**Pattern Used**:
```csharp
// EnhancedSpawner.cs - Object culling implementation
void CullObjectsBehindCamera(float cameraX)
{
    float cullX = cameraX - cullDistance;
    
    GameObject[] allObjects = FindObjectsByType<GameObject>(FindObjectsSortMode.None);
    foreach (GameObject obj in allObjects)
    {
        if (obj.name.Contains("AnchorPoint") || obj.name.Contains("Collectible"))
        {
            if (obj.transform.position.x < cullX)
            {
                Destroy(obj);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Memory management** - prevents objects from accumulating
- **Performance** - avoids garbage collection spikes
- **Scalability** - can handle hundreds of objects efficiently
- **Simple implementation** - easy to understand and maintain

### 4. **Pattern-Based Procedural Generation**

**What I Learned**: Multiple anchor patterns create varied, engaging gameplay.

**Pattern Used**:
```csharp
// EnhancedSpawner.cs - Pattern-based generation
public enum PatternType
{
    Cluster, Line, Stairs, Pyramid, Wall, Spiral, Cross, Diamond, Square
}

void SpawnAnchorPattern()
{
    PatternType pattern = patterns[Random.Range(0, patterns.Length)];
    switch (pattern)
    {
        case PatternType.Cluster:
            SpawnClusterAt(basePosition);
            break;
        case PatternType.Line:
            SpawnLineAt(basePosition);
            break;
        // etc...
    }
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- **Variety** - different patterns require different strategies
- **Replayability** - random patterns mean unique runs
- **Engagement** - players must adapt to different arrangements
- **Scalability** - easy to add new patterns
